### Graphics library for the Il Matto Board with attached screen

This was originally written in 2013 by a small group of first year students, who couldn't wait to be given the official library

It quickly became both faster and more feature complete than the library that they were later given

It is now on the internet for current and future students to use and possibly even expand upon
