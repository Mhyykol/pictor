# Pictor 0.3.1b
### Graphics library for the Il Matto Board with attached screen

#### Warning: pictor 0.3.2 and onwards is not backwards compatible with earlier pictors due to re-worked function names

This was originally written in 2013 by a small group of first year students (Henry Wilson, Terra Barber, Emma Curati-Alasonatti and Chris Turner.), who couldn't wait to be given the official library

It quickly became both faster and more feature complete than the library that they were later given

It is now on the internet for current and future students to use and possibly even expand upon

### Usage

The library can be used by simply including pictor.h and any font files you wish to use, pictor.h automatically includes pictor.c so no special compile arguments are needed

Usage of the functions is best seen by looking at the example program, which also comes with pre-compiled .hex (compiled with version 0.3.2 of the library)
